# FreeRTOS
`The FreeRTOS download includes source code for every processor port, and every demo application. Placing all the ports in a single download greatly simplifies distribution, but the number of files may seem daunting. The directory structure is however very simple, and the FreeRTOS real time kernel is contained in just 3 files (additional files are required if software timer, event group or co-routine functionality is required).`

`In computing, an event is an action or occurrence recognized by software, often originating asynchronously from the external environment, that may be handled by the software. Computer events can be generated or triggered by the system, by the user or in other ways. Typically, events are handled synchronously with the program flow, that is, the software may have one or more dedicated places where events are handled, frequently an event loop. A source of events includes the user, who may interact with the software by way of, for example, keystrokes on the keyboard. Another source is a hardware device such as a timer. Software can also trigger its own set of events into the event loop, e.g. to communicate the completion of a task. Software that changes its behavior in response to events is said to be event-driven, often with the goal of being interactive.`
